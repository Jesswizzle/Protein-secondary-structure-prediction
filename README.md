Predicting protein secondary structure is a fundamental task in bioinformatics. 
The Chou-Fasman method is used here predict alpha-helices and beta-sheets based on amino acid propensities.
This method assigns propensities (probabilities) to each amino acid for forming alpha-helices, beta-sheets, or coils.
By analyzing a protein sequence and calculating these propensities over a window of amino acids, the method predicts the secondary structure of the protein.
